# X-Arcade XInput Mapper UI

X-Arcade XInput Mapper is an application designed to simplify the process of configuring the virtual XBox controller [X-Arcade XInput](https://github.com/mikew/xarcade-xinput).

With X-Arcade XInput Mapper, users can create a configuration file to be used with [X-Arcade XInput](https://github.com/mikew/xarcade-xinput). The software is designed to accept inputs from an X-Arcade machine or any keyboard or [I-PAC](https://www.ultimarc.com/control-interfaces/i-pacs/i-pac4-board/) based Arcade machine and map them to the virtual XBox controller.

The application features a simple interface that guides users through the mapping process. Users can choose which Arcade buttons and joysticks they want to map to buttons and the D-pad on the virtual XBox controller. They can also customize the analog stick and trigger mappings.
